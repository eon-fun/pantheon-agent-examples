### Description:
This is the Twitter Echo Bot. It operates in two steps:

1) Prompt Creation: The bot asks users to provide a few words to generate a prompt.
For example, inputs like "crypto-skizo-degen" or "karen-daytrader-wife"
will be used to create a unique prompt.

2) Account Tracking: Users provide a list of Twitter accounts they want to monitor.

### How the Bot Works:
The bot actively monitors the specified Twitter accounts. When one of these accounts posts a tweet,
the bot processes it using the generated prompt, creates a new version of the post,
and automatically publishes it to the user's own Twitter account.
